## ðŸ§ª Development Approach
We are following **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** strictly:
1. Write failing tests (Red)
2. Make minimal code to pass (Green)
3. Refactor for better structure (Refactor)

All implementation should begin with test creation.

## ðŸ§± Architecture Guideline
- Layered Architecture: **Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository**
- Use in-memory data structures (no external DB)
- Follow **Clean Architecture** and **SOLID principles**
- Log behavior using `org.slf4j.Logger`

## ðŸ§° Dependencies & Tools
- **Spring Boot Starter Web**
- **Lombok** (for boilerplate code)
- **JUnit 5** (for testing)
- **Jacoco** (for coverage reporting)
- **Gradle Kotlin DSL (build.gradle.kts)**

The project runs with:
```bash
./gradlew test
